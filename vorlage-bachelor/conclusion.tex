\chapter{Conclusion}

During the course of this thesis a program has been developed which is able to
create, run and destroy linux containers. The configuration of these containers
has been altered to provide a better security level for the host's operating system
regarding the execution of untrusted C programs by students from the ``info 2'' module.
There have been several test C programs written that try to attack the system or
check for capabilities. These programs have been executed through this software to
check the vulnerability of the containers.
Furthermore, the different security modules of \textit{lxc} have been investigated.

All tests have been successfully averted and the executed process has got none of the
available kernel capabilities.
