\chapter{Daemon structure}

\section{Purpose}

Since lxc requires the processing user to have root privileges, precautions need to be taken to ensure
the safety of the system. Mainly we do not want to have root privileges for more actions other than those who really
need these. As a consequence programs are passed to the lxc_daemon who then performs the container creation
and execution and in the end returns the results back to an unprivileged program (e.g. the mail server).
