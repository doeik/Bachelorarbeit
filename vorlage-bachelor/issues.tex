\section{Lxc-python api and threads}

In general c-code is not thread safe, so when executing a c-function through python the default
behaviour of the python interpreter is to block all other running threads until said function returns\cite{gil}.\\
When executing the attach\_wait function all threads would be blocked until it returned. Unfortunately
this made it impossible to stop the container through a timer thread atfer a certain amount of time had
passed (not to speak of running more than one container simultaneously).\\
However there are macros defined in python.h which are able to tell python to temporarily allow threads.
Turning in this patch\cite{bugreport} resolved the issue.
