\section{Lxc-python API and threads}

When executing an external C function \textit{Python} assumes by default that it is not thread safe and
therefore applies its \textit{global interpreter lock} \cite{gil}. This blocks the further execution of all other
threads for as long as the function is running.\\
When executing the \texttt{attach\_wait} function provided by the \textit{python-lxc} API which runs a command
inside a container and returns its exit value
all threads would be blocked until it returned. Unfortunately,
this made it impossible to stop the container through a timer thread after a certain amount of time had
passed (not to speak of running more than one container simultaneously).\\
However, there are macros defined in \texttt{python.h} which are able to tell \textit{python} to temporarily allow threads.
Turning in this patch\cite{bugreport} resolved the issue. The patch has been accepted and integrated into the project.
